/**
* Fizz Buzz
* 
* In this project, we're going to build FizzBuzz. It's a children's game where
* you count from 1 to 20. Easy, right? Here's the catch: 
* 
* Instead of saying a number that is divisible by 3, say "Fizz".
* And instead of saying a number that is divisible by 5, say "Buzz".
* For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, say "FizzBuzz".
* 
* Print your results to the console.
* 
* If your code is correct, the output will be:
*  
* 1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz
*
